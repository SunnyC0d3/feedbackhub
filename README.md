# FeedbackHub

A multi-tenant SaaS feedback and issue tracking platform with AI-powered semantic search and analysis.

Built with **Laravel 11**, **MySQL**, **Redis**, **OpenAI**, and **Pinecone**.

---

## Features

- **Multi-tenant isolation** — automatic `tenant_id` scoping via global Eloquent scopes; one tenant can never see another's data
- **Hierarchical organisation** — Tenant → Division → Project → Feedback with role-based access (Admin, Manager, Member, Support)
- **AI-powered summarization** — GPT-4o-mini generates structured summaries (themes, issues, positives, recommendations) across any feedback set
- **Semantic search** — query feedback by meaning using OpenAI embeddings + Pinecone vector similarity
- **Background job processing** — notifications and embeddings processed async via Redis queues with retry and idempotency
- **Usage tracking and cost monitoring** — per-tenant daily AI spend tracked with configurable caps
- **Structured observability** — JSON logs with request context, slow query detection, business metrics, and system health checks

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+
- MySQL 8.0 (running on port 3307 by default)
- Redis
- Composer
- OpenAI API key
- Pinecone API key + index

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies

## Architecture

FeedbackHub is built around four architectural pillars:

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
All tenants share one database. Every tenant-scoped table has a `tenant_id` column. A `TenantScope` global scope automatically appends `WHERE tenant_id = ?` to every query when a user is authenticated. The `BelongsToTenant` trait applies this scope and auto-sets `tenant_id` on record creation.

See [ADR 001](docs/adr/001-multi-tenant-shared-database.md) for the decision rationale.

### 2. Event-Driven Side Effects
The `Feedback` model fires domain events (`FeedbackCreated`, `FeedbackStatusChanged`). Listeners handle side effects independently:
- `NotifyOnFeedbackCreated` → dispatches notification job
- `EmbedFeedbackOnCreated` → dispatches embedding job
- `ClearMetricsCacheOnFeedback` → invalidates cached dashboard metrics

This keeps the model decoupled from infrastructure concerns.

See [ADR 006](docs/adr/006-event-driven-architecture.md) for the decision rationale.

### 3. Service + Repository Layers
- **Services** — `FeedbackManagementService` (writes), `FeedbackAnalysisService` (AI pipeline)
- **Repositories** — `FeedbackRepository`, `ProjectRepository` (data access)
- **Light CQRS** — `CreateFeedbackCommand`, `UpdateFeedbackStatusCommand`, `GetProjectFeedbackQuery`, `GetTenantMetricsQuery`

### 4. AI Pipeline
```
User query
  → EmbeddingService (OpenAI) → 1536-dim vector
  → PineconeService → top-K similar feedback IDs
  → FeedbackRepository → Feedback models
  → AiService (GPT-4o-mini) → structured summary
```

Full architecture diagrams (including sequence diagrams) are in [docs/DIAGRAMS.md](docs/DIAGRAMS.md).

## Key Concepts

### Tenant Isolation
Every model that uses the `BelongsToTenant` trait is automatically scoped to the authenticated user's tenant. You cannot accidentally query another tenant's data — the scope is enforced at the Eloquent query builder level.

```php
// This only returns feedback for the current tenant — always
$feedback = Feedback::where('status', 'open')->get();
```

### Semantic Search vs Keyword Search
Traditional search matches exact words. Semantic search matches meaning. A query for `"slow load times"` will surface feedback titled `"App feels sluggish on 3G"` because their vector representations are similar.

### Job Idempotency
Background jobs use cache-based idempotency keys to prevent duplicate execution. If a job is retried (due to a transient failure), it checks whether it has already completed before doing any work. Keys expire after 24 hours.

### Cost Tracking
Every OpenAI API call logs token usage and estimated cost. `AiService` aggregates daily usage per tenant in Redis and enforces configurable spending caps before making API calls.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Full test suite (31 tests, 80 assertions)
php artisan test

# By suite
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
php artisan test --testsuite=Integration
php artisan test --testsuite=Performance
```

Tests use a dedicated `feedbackhub_test` database. All external APIs (OpenAI, Pinecone) are mocked — no real API calls are made during testing.

---

## Monitoring

```bash
# Watch for slow queries (>100ms)
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep slow_query

# Watch for job failures
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep job_failed

# Watch AI usage
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep ai_usage_tracked
```

```php
// System health check (via tinker)
App\Services\MetricsService::getSystemHealth();
// Returns: health_score, failed_jobs, queue_depth, cache status, db status

// AI usage stats for a tenant (last 7 days)
app(App\Services\AiService::class)->getUsageStats($tenantId, 7);
```
